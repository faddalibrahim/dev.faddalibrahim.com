# Introduction

Recursive thinking is one of the crazy rides in the DSA journey. Beyond just **figuring out the base and recursive cases**, the mechanics easily gets out of control, making it challenging to trace the flow properly. Whereas loops may, in some cases, be more applicable, recursion beats the game with elegance! (although, with memory trade-offs)

Moreover, there are problems that are just too difficult or even impossible to solve without recursion. Example of such is the focus of this post. Note that this post is not to teach you about recursion.

Hence, to feel comfortable following through to the end, you must fit the following profile.

1. You know the basics of recursion and have solved a few simple questions around it

2. You have some knowledge of trees and how to perform a depth-first search/traversal

3. You know basic ReactJs and Typescript (states, props, map, filter)

Here is a [live link](https://react-nested-comments-system.netlify.app) to the final version of the app. This post doesn't highlight anything about styling, layout and other aesthetics you might see in the final version. The full code is hosted on this [github repo](https://github.com/faddalibrahim/nested-comments-system-react) for your perusal.

With that being said, we are good to go. Find below the roadmap!

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## Goals?

My goal for this post in not to spoon feed you with code that you can plug into your app (chatGPT can help you with that or the [github repo](https://github.com/faddalibrahim/nested-comments-system-react)), but to breakdown the mechanics of the behavior of a nested comments system and make you understand what is happening on a deeper level. Ultimately, you should be able to recreate the logic and customize it to fit your needs. Also, its a future time-saver for me because I have a really terrible memory and these technical articles I write come in handy whenever I need a refresher.

We will do this in 2 steps.

1. Build out the foundational logic for the behavior of the comments system using textbook/classroom knowledge
2. Build the setup and the basic ReactJS components needed to get the app functional (No styling, event-handling etc)

## PART 1 : Foundational Logic

### A simple recursive function

This function is going to be a foundational reference point and a low-level template for how a nested comments system would behave. It takes a positive integer as input, then it prints the integer and all other positive integers less than the input. Let's call it `printNumLadder`

```ts:printNumberLadder.ts
/**
 * Prints a positive integer and all other positive integers less than it
 *
 * @param {num} - the input positive integer
 *
 * @return void
*/
function printNumLadder(num: number) {
  // base case
  if (num <= 0) return

  console.log(num)

  // recursive case
  printNumLadder(num - 1)
}

printNumLadder(3);
```

**Result**

![Recursive Function](/static/images/nested-comments/basic-recursive-func.svg)

The recursive flow of this function mimics the behavior of a nested comments system -- We render a parent comment, then proceed to render all the sub comments in it by recursively calling its sub-comments till there are none.

The **Base Case**, `if num <= 0` is linguistically similar to `if there are no more sub comments...`

The **Recursive Case** `pNL(num - 1)` is similar to `call the next comment below this one`

Translating the previous code to reflect the comments system, we have..

```ts:logComment.ts
interface Comment {
  text: string
  child: Comment | null
}

function logComment(comment: Comment) {
  /**
   * BASE CASE
   * stop if there are no more comments
  */
  if (comment === null) return

  // print the current comment text
  console.log(comment.text)

  /**
   * RECURSIVE CASE
   * call the next child comment below this one
  */
  logComment(comment.child)
}
```

However, the above setup doesn't work. It makes sense if there is just one parent comment that has a single child comment, which in turn has a single child comment and so on.

But NO! In reality, there are multiple comments. Each comment has a number of children (replies). Each child (reply) has its own children and so on. Therefore we have a **TREE**! And how do we traverse trees recursively? You are right! **Depth-First Traversal**.

![Comment Tree Illustration](/static/images/nested-comments/comment-tree.svg)

### Depth-First-Search/Traversal

Now that we are aware that we are dealing with a tree, we know we need to traverse recursively in a **depth-first** fashion to perform any mofifications on the **Comment Tree**. So, let's modify the `logComment` function to do just that

Before that, here are some key reminders to note.

1. The main components of a comment we will focus on are `text` and `children/sub comments`. The sub comments/children are what we linguistically call a **replies**. But lets call them **children** for the sake of technicality.

```ts
interface Comment {
  text: string | null
  children: Comment[] | null
}
```

2. For comments sections on social media, there isnt a starting root comment from which all others branch out. Its rather a list of independent `Top-Level` comments written by different users. Its from these `Top-Level` comments that other users may choose to reply to.

So, there is literally no ROOT. But we can create an **imaginary/fake** root comment. This imaginary/fake root will have no `text`, but its children will be these `Top-Level` Comments if there are any. This makes it possible to pass a ROOT to initiate the recursive chain.

![Comment Tree Illustration](/static/images/nested-comments/imaginary-root.svg)

**Displaying Comments**

```ts:logCommentWithDFS.ts

function logCommentWithDFS(comment: Comment) {
  // base case
  if (!comment) return

  console.log(comment.text)

  // recursive case with DFS
  for (let i = 0; i < comment.children.length; i++) {
    logCommentWithDFS(comment.children[i])
  }
}
```

**Adding Comments To Comment Tree**

To add a comment to the tree, we need to know exactly where to attach it. A comment can either be a **top-level comment** or a **sub-comment (reply)**.

For **sub-comments**, we need to know the **id** of the parent comment they belong to since they will be deeply nested in the tree.

**Top level Comments** dont have parents; they are right at the top level and there is no need to go any levels below to attach them. Therefore, we can add them directly to the children of the **imaginary/fake** root.

```ts:addCommentWithDFS.ts
const fakeRoot = {
  text: null,
  children: [] // will contain top-level comments
}

/**
 * Inserts a comment at the appropriate node in the comment tree
 *
 * @param {commentRoot} - the root of the comment tree
 * @param {parentId} - the id of the parent to which the comment belongs
 * @param {commentText} - the comment's text content
 *
*/
function addCommentWithDFS(
    commentRoot: Comment | null,
    parentId: string | null,
    commentText: string
  ) {

  // base case
  if (!commentRoot) return

  // inserting a top-level comment
  if(parentId === null){
    commentRoot.children.push({
      text: commentText,
      children: []
    })
    return;
  }

  // recursive case with DFS to attach sub-comments (replies)
  for (let i = 0; i < commentRoot.children.length; i++) {
    const currComment = commentRoot.children[i];

    if(currComment.id === parentId){
      currComment.children.push({
        text: commentText,
        children: []
      })
      return;
    }

    addCommentWithDFS(comment, comment.id, commentText)

  }
}

```

**Deleting Comments From The Comment Tree**

To delete a comment, we need to know is its **id** and its parent's.

Then perform DFS to find the parent, after which we loop through its children to filter out the target child.

Remember also that Top-Level Comments dont have parents and so should be treated differently like we did previously.

```ts:deleteCommentWithDFS.tsx

function deleteCommentWithDFS(
  commentRoot: Comment | null,
  parentId: string | null,
  commentId: string
){

  if(commentRoot === null) return;

  // For Top-Level Comments
  if(parentId === null){
    commentRoot.children = commentRoot.children.filter((child: Comment) => {
      return child.id != commentId
    })
    return;
  }

  // recursive case with DFS to delete sub-comments (replies)
  for (let i = 0; i < commentRoot.children.length; i++) {
    const currComment = commentRoot.children[i];

    if(currComment.id === parentId){
      currComment.children = currComment.children.filter((child: Comment) => {
        return child.id != commentId
      })
      return;
    }

    deleteCommentWithDFS(currComment, parentId, commentId)
  }
}
```

We did it! All we need to do now is implement this same logic using a frontend framework of our choice. For me, ReactJS is that guy!

## PART 2: Building the APP

Below is a visual representation of the app. Starting from innermost component (CommentBlock.tsx), I will explain what happens at each level.

In order not to clutter each section, we will focus on the code needed only for that section. Then we can put all together in the end. But keep in mind that the sections are connected and what happens in a previous section is connected to the next and may even use code from previous sections.

Secondly, any onChange or onClick actions will not be demonstrated. We are assuming that those actions have been triggerd and all we need is to call the function being called in response to those actions.

![React App Hierarchy](/static/images/nested-comments/react-app-hierarchy.svg)

### Extending the comment interface

Let's extend the previous **Comment** interface to include **id** and **user** and **dates**.

```ts
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  profileImg: string
}

interface Comment {
  id: string
  text: string
  user: User
  replies: Comment[]
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Rendering a single comment using CommentBlock.tsx

The **CommentBlock.tsx** component is the visual representation of a single comment. It is what users would see and interact with. It takes a comment data as an input prop and renders it on the screen.

Additionally, this component will recursively render any replies/sub-comments for the current comment.

```tsx:CommentBlock.tsx

export default function CommentBlock({comment}){
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{comment.text}</p>
      <div>
        <button>reply</button>
        <button>delete</button>
      </div>

      {/**Recursive rendering of comment replies*/}
      {
        comment.replies.length > 0 && comment.replies.map(
          (reply: Comment) => <CommentBlock comment={reply}/>
        )
      }
    </div>
  )
}

```

### Rendering all Comments to the screen using CommentThread.tsx

This component will take an array of all the comments, loop through and render them to the screen by passing each comment's data to **CommentBlock.tsx**

By looping through and passing each comment's data to `CommentBlock.tsx`, it starts the recursive chain that results in the rendering of sub comments for each top-level comment.

```tsx:CommentThread.tsx
export default function CommentThread({allComments}) {
    return allComments.map(
      (comment: Comment) => {
          return <CommentBlock key={comment.id} comment={comment}/>
      }
    )
  }
}
```

Finally, **CommentSection.tsx** encloses everything. It is also where comment state is defined and pass down as props to **CommentThread** and **CommentBlock**.

```tsx:CommentSection.tsx
export default function CommentSection(){

  const [allComments, setAllComments] = useState<Comment[]>(dummyCommentData);

  return <CommentThread
            allComments={allComments}
            setAllComments={setAllComments}
          />
}
```

### Adding a comment to the tree

To perform any modifications to the comment tree, you guessed it -- we will use **setAllComments** set state action.

Its important to remember that adding a comment to the tree will be in 2 ways. Either as a **Top-Level comment** or as a **sub-comment/reply** to a parent comment. Hence, the way in which we use **setAllComments** to modify the state will be different.

1. Adding a comment as top-level

```ts

function newComment(commentText: string, currentUser: User){
  return {
    id: String(Math.random()),
    text: commentText,
    user: currentUser
    replies: []
    createdAt: new Date()
  }
}


function addTopLevelComment(commentText, currentUser){
  setAllComments((prevComments) => {
    return [newComment(commentText, currentUser), ...prevComments.]
  }
  )
}

```

2. Adding a comment as a **child/reply**

For this, we need to know exactly where to insert the comment like we deduced before in the **Part 1 of this post**. What do we need to know? The **id** of the parent comment to which we are attaching the reply.

Secondly, we need to perform a depth first traversal to find it since it is most likely deep down the comment tree.

```ts
/**
 * adds a reply to a parent comment
 *
 * @param {commentText} - the text of the new comment reply
 * @param {parentId} - the id of the parent comment to which the reply is added to
*/
function addReply(commentText: string, parentId:string){
  const commensWithReplies = [...allComments]
  addNestedCommentDFS(commentsWithReplies, commentText, parentId)
  setAllComments(commentsWithReplies)
}

/**
 * performs DFS on a comment subtree to update its children
 *
 * @param {commentWithReplies} - the comment subtree
 * @param commentText - the text of the new comment to be added as a child
 * @param {parentId} - the parent comment to search for
*/

function addNestedCommentDFS(
  commentsWithReplies:Comment[],
  commentText: string,
  parentId:string
  ) {

  for (let i = 0; i < commentsWithReplies.length; i++){
    const comment = commentsWithReplies[i]

    if(comment.id === parentId){
      comment.replies [
        newComment(commentText, currentUser),
        ...comment.replies
      ]
    }else{
      addNestedComment(comment.replies, commentText, parentId)
    }
  }


}
```

### Deleting a comment

Again, from Part 1 of this post, we deduced taht we needed to know comment's id and its parent's id.

1. Deleting a top level comment

```ts
/**
 * Deletes a comment at the top level
 *
 * @param {commentId} - the id of the comment to be deleted
 */
function deleteTopLevelComment(commentId: string) {
  setAllComments((prevComments: Comment[]) =>
    prevComments.filter((comment: Comment) => comment.id != commentId)
  )
}
```

2. Deleting a nested comment/reply

```ts
function deleteReply() {
  const commentsWithReplies = [...allComments]
  deleteNestedCommentDFS(commentsWithReplies, commentId, parentId)
  setAllComments(commentsWithReplies)
}

function deleteNestedCommentDFS(
  commentsWithReplies: Comment[],
  commentId: string,
  parentId: string
) {
  for (let i = 0; i < commentsWithReplies.length; i++) {
    const comment = commentsWithReplies[i]
    if (comment.id === parentId) {
      comment.replies = comment.replies.filter((comment) => comment.id !== commentId)
    } else {
      deleteNestedComment(comment.replies, commentId, parentId)
    }
  }
}
```

## Problems

.....in progress (ignore)

1. Using Recursion in production apps
2. Space and Time Complexity Trade-offs.

## Wrapping Up

This has been an fun ride for me. From diagramming, editting, debugging, coding, testing and to the final version of this post. There is many more ideas currently in development and if you loved this, you should subsribe down below. Your comments are welcome as well.

Here are some interesting things you can include on your own.

1. Connect to a nosql database (firebase/supabase)
2. Include Web sockets for realtime comment updates from different users
3. Comment Notifications

```ts:thanks.ts
console.log('Thanks for reading');
```
