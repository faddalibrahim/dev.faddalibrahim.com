# Introduction

I know you are quite the algo wonderkid, but here is a question that might knock you off your high horse - **what does a time complexity of $$log(n)$$ really mean?**

Well, you would reference binary search and say, halving the problem size at each step results in $$log(n)$$. But it's still vague. What does $$log$$ even mean? How did $$log$$ steal the spotlight? What's the root derivation? Where does it come from?

Unlike $$n$$ and $$n^2$$, which are quite intuitive, $$log(n)$$ is derived quite differently.

In 3 steps, I will build upon micro analogies already familiar to you to lead to that big eureka moment. Calmly stay with me and let's find out!

## Inverse operations in mathematics

Let me bore you a little with primary school math - Plus (+) is the opposite of minus (-) and division (/) is the opposite of multiplication (\*).

As such, $$8 + 2 = 10$$ can be re-written as $$8 - 10 = -2$$. In natural language, we say `2 added to 8 is 10` and `10 subtracted from 8 is -2` respectively. There are a few other ways to re-arrange the same equation but expressing them in natural language will be different. The same can be applied to `2 * 10 = 20` and `2 = 20/10`.

This simple yet powerful logic is the reason we are able to easily solve algebraic equations. We could go a bit further to reference trigonometric and square root inversions, but we have enough base to proceed.

## Indices and Logarithms

Indices are intuitive. $$3^4 = 81$$ is mathematically read as `3 raised to the power of 4 is 81`. In natural language, `multiplying 3 by itself 4 times gives 81`.

Now let's introduce Logarithms, which are the inverse of indices.

Just as we can re-write $$8 + 2 = 10$$ as $$8 - 10 = -2$$, we can also re-write $$3^4 = 81$$ as $$\log_{3} 81 = 4$$.

The image below summarizes the inverse relationship.

$$\log_{3} 81 = 4$$ is mathematically read as `log base 3 of 81 is 4`. Expressing in natural language is where it makes a lot of sense.

$$3^4 = ?$$ :

- Natual Language : `3 raised to the power/exponent of 4 is what?`

$$\log_{3} 81 = ?$$ :

- Natural Language: `To get 81, what power/exponent do we raise 3 to?`
- Or more clearly: `To get 81, how many times do we need to multiply 3 by itself?`

Notice how the Logarithms rephrase the question by starting with the **ANSWER!** (Refer back to the diagram for a visual representation)

> $$3^4 = 81 \iff \log_{3} 81 = 4$$

## The math

In binary search, we repeatedly halve the problem size until we reduce it to a size of 1.

The time complexity is basically how many times do we need to halve the problem size to reach that final size of 1. Sounds familiar? Absolutely yes - because that is exactly what logarithms represent!

In the illustration below, the input size is 8, which gets halved 3 times to get the final input size of 1

Hence, given an initial problem size of `n`, mathematically, all we are saying is

$$
n *  \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{1}{2} * ... = 1
$$

if we use `x` to represent that unknown number of times needed to halve the problem size to 1, we now have

$$
n * \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) ^ x = 1
$$

which, upon further simplification, becomes

$$
n * \frac{1^x}{2^x} = 1
$$

$$
n * 1^x = 1 * 2^x
$$

$$
n = 2 ^ x
$$

$$
2 ^ x = n
$$

From here, we can proceed in 2 ways

**1. Directly rewrite the exponential equation as a logarithm**

$$2^x = n \iff \log_{2} n = x$$

**2. Mathematically solve for x using rules of logarithms**

$$
2 ^ x = n
$$

Take the logarithm (base 2) of both sides:

$$
\log_{2}2 ^ x = \log_2 n
$$

Apply the logarithm Power Rule $$\log_b (a^c) = c \log_b a$$

$$
x\log_{2}2 = \log_2 n
$$

Apply the Identity Rule $$\log_b b = 1$$

$$
x \cdot 1 = \log_2 n
$$

Finally:

$$
x = \log_2 n
$$
