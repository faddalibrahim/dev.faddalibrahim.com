## Introduction

I am sometimes baffled by my god complex. For example, I believe that wooing Cleopatra would be, for me, a cakewalk. I can't prove that, though; you've just got to believe me. Today, My endorphins are through the roof, and my main-character syndrome is at an all-time high. So, here comes my little grandstanding: This is the first of many awesome content and definitely your soon-to-be favorite blog for amazing technical content. Delusions of grandeur? No, these are delusions of a grandmaster. Let me be a little informal and off-topic as I explain why you must pay attention to my technical blog. I promise its just for today!

First off, there are 3 rappers that I am genuinely mesmerised by: Eminem, JayCole and NF. In fact, let me share with you my favourite lines from each.


`when you are so good, but you can't say it cuz it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore' (Eminem, No Love)`


`'I studied the greats; I am the greatest right now'. (Jay Cole, Middle Child)`


`'You call me what you want, but never call me forgettable'. (NF, The Search)`


Why am I head over heels in love? 
1. Delusional Confidence in their craft
2. Elaborate storytelling and creative cadence.


You might be thinking, what has rap got to do with software and technical content? Well, rap is written, and software is....ummm....written, too. Yes, although differently, the parallels are striking. I have been on the extreme ends of the spectrum in both, and the intricate steps and level of thinking for meticulous delivery are similar.


Here is what I meanâ€¦

1. Both rely on 'language' to express an idea.
2. Software is debugged; Writing is edited
3. Both undergo a review and auditing; 
4. both occasionally involve collaborations with others.

You get it now, huh? This parallel may no really but necessary, but I feel good having flexed my superiority in rap tastse


## Goals
Hence my goal for this blog is to employ the seductive powers of writing to bring you unparalleled insights on from **Computer Science**, **Software Engineering**, **UX** and **Mathematics**

Here, we re-invent the wheel, solve interesting algorithmic questions, build apps from scratch, and learn some tricks. We won't be `centring divs` or solving `Fizzbuzz`. Leave that to the kids. it will get increasingly get complex as we go. Plain technical writing can be fuzzy and abstract sometimes. That is why I will supplement it with elaborate diagrams and animations to ease understanding.


## Conclusion
Still in doubt about this blog being the best you would ever come to follow? Well, I ain't gonna leave you on a cliffhanger. Find out what I have prepared for you in this next post
