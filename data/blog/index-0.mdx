## Introduction

I am sometimes baffled by my god complex. For example, I believe that wooing Cleopatra would be, for me, a cakewalk. I can't prove that, though; you've just got to believe me. Today, My endorphins are through the roof, and my main-character syndrome is at an all-time high. So, here comes my little grandstanding... ðŸ˜Ž

This is the first of many awesome posts and definitely your soon-to-be favorite blog for amazing technical content. Delusions of grandeur? Nah, these are valid delusions of a grandmaster. Let me be a little informal and off-topic as I explain why you must pay attention to my technical blog. I promise its just for today!

First off, there are only 3 rappers that I am genuinely impressed by: **Eminem**, **J Cole** and **NF**. In fact, let me share with you my favourite lines from each.


> when you are so good, but you can't say it 'cuz it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore ~ Eminem - No Love`


> I studied the greats; I am the greatest right now ~ J Cole - Middle Child


> You call me what you want, but never call me forgettable ~ NF - The Search


I love the.. 
1. Delusional Confidence in their craft
2. Elaborate storytelling and creative cadence.


You might be thinking, what has rap got to do with this blog? 

Well, rap is written, and code is written, too. Yes, although differently, the are some parallels.

Here is what I meanâ€¦

1. Both rely on 'language' to express an idea.
2. Code is debugged; Writing is edited.
3. There is a review/audit process for both;

Of course, we wont be writing just code and this comparison is not really sufficient. But yeah, I just wanted to stress my love for meticulous writing and also to flex my superiority in rap tastes. Hence...

## Goals
My goal for this blog is to employ the seductive powers of writing to bring you unparalleled insights on **Computer Science**, **Software Engineering**, **UX** and **Mathematics**.

Here, we 
1. re-invent the wheel
2. solve interesting algorithmic questions
3. build apps from scratch
4. learn some tricks. 

We won't be 
1. Centring *Divs*
2. Solving Fizzbuzz. 

Leave that to the kids. 

Plain technical writing can be fuzzy and abstract sometimes. That is why I will enhance my writing with elaborate illustrations to ease understanding.


## Conclusion
Still in doubt about this technical blog being the best you would ever come to follow? Well, Let me leave you on a cliffhander while I prepare my next post. See you soon, buddy, and don't forget to subscribe!
