**There are 2 types of software engineers: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools ~ teachyourselfcs.com**

My talent lies in being able learn anything quickly and immediately applying the knowledge in doing creative things.

On the flipside, I have a terrible memory. Therefore, I document a lot in writing. I write to remember, to learn and to share.

I go extreme lengths to deconstruct things that pique my interest and always on the lookout for amazing ways to do things differently.

I am a master of getting things done with meticulous delivery!

This technical blog is a space for my unbridled creativity, where I use the seductive powers of my writing to explore my love triangle - Programming, Design, Mathematics.

Other things I love are Anime, Memes and Liverpool!

I'm always ready for the next challenge and intellectual thrill in the arena of life!

Welcome to my world! 🔥
