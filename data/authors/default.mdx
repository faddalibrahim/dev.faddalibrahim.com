**"There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because theyâ€™re familiar with a few high level tools" ~ teachyourselfcs.com**

Here is a space for my unbridled creativity and fun, where I use the seductive powers of my writing to explore my love triangle - Programming, Design, Mathematics.

Other things I love are Anime, Memes and Liverpool!
